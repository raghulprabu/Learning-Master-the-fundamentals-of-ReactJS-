➡️ What is Componenets 
 Components are Independent  and Reusable  bit of code  they serve the same purposes as javaScript Function code but working  isolated and return   Html

  ✌️ It has two type 
  --> function based Componenets
  --> class based componenets 

 ➡️syntax

const Components = () => {  ---> function name start with uppercase 
  return (
    <>

  )
   }
export default Components



➡️ React idea → Break your app into small pieces (called components). 
Example: Button, Search bar, Table row.

 ✌️Visual states → Each component can look different depending on data. 
Example: “Out of stock” text turns red.

✌️ Data flow → Components are connected, and data passes from parent → child. Example: Search bar sends text → table filters products.
