🖐️What is a Higher Order Component?

A Higher Order Component (HOC) is like a wrapper that adds extra features to your React components.

Note: HOCs are functions that take a component and return an enhanced version of that component.


👍 Think of it like putting a case on your phone - the case adds new features (like water protection) without changing the phone itself.
