➡️props stands for properties.
➡️Props are a way to pass data from a parent component to a child component.
➡️They work like function parameters and are read-only.
➡️In HTML terms, they’re similar to attributes.


👋Why Props are Important

✌️Instead of hardcoding values, you pass them in.
✌️Props allow data flow from parent → child (one-way binding).


👋 Props Can Be Anything

Strings

Numbers
